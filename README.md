Hi! I'm Mónica Gómez, also known as Autumn64. I am a Computer Systems Engineering student from México, and I'm a proud trans woman and Esperantist. I started developing software in C# back in 2014, but my first contacts with programming date back from 2011 with Commodore BASIC. I also started using GNU/Linux in 2014 with Debian 6, and since then I've witnessed the evolution of the GNU/Linux distributions and community. Nowadays I use [Artix Linux](https://artixlinux.org/) and I develop free, libre and open-source software in C, Python and JavaScript, although I can also code in Java, C++, Rust and C#.

On October 2023 I won the [contest at MiaVivo.net](https://www.miavivo.net/?status/1-1-1698395536) with the song "Ĝia nomo estas Mia Vivo", and I am an active contributor to Esperantujo through my [PeerTube channel](https://tube.tchncs.de/a/autumn64/video-channels), and by translating all my software to Esperanto. I am also an [indie musician](https://www.autumn64.xyz/music.html), and I frequently upload programming tutorials [in Spanish](https://video.hardlimit.com/c/autumn64/videos) and [Esperanto](https://tube.tchncs.de/c/autumn64.eo/videos).

- I celebrate my birthday on November 10th.
- My pronouns are She/They.
- I speak Spanish, English, Portuguese, French and Esperanto.
- I am a linguistics nerd.
- I follow the philosophy of [optimistic nihilism](https://iv.nboeck.de/watch?v=MBRqu0YOH14).
- I'm an ex-catholic, and an ex-muslim.
- [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) FTW!
- I'm no longer fine with [systemd](https://www.osnews.com/story/28026/editorial-thoughts-on-systemd-and-the-freedom-to-choose/)!
- I have an Xbox One. Nowadays I prefer playing on [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199486117495/) though.
- I use Artix [Linux](https://pawb.social/post/5079071) as my daily driver.
- I used GNOME for years until I switched to KDE due to fractional scaling issues with my current monitor.
- I love maths even if I understand nothing of them!
- I love quantum mechanics and astronomy/astrophysics.
- I quit using any form of privative social media except for Discord (partially), MiaVivo.net and WhatsApp on December 2023.
- About the point above, I still use Discord, but not inside the Discord's website or app. I actually interact with it through a bridge I made on a private Matrix space I recently created. In the case of MiaVivo.net, although it's technically a copyrighted social media, the technology it uses (PeepSo) is released under the [GPL v2 or later](https://www.peepso.com/license/). In the case of WhatsApp, even though I prefer 100% XMPP, I still need WhatsApp because my university sends its statements and stuff only through it, and sometimes by e-mail.
- I switched to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/Autumn64) on November 2023, while I just use my [GitHub](https://github.com/Autumn64) to contribute to the FLOSS projects I like/I'm interested in, and to mirror my repositories from Codeberg #GiveUpGitHub.
- F*ck Microsoft Word/Google Docs/Apple Pages, all my homies use [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)!
- I used to be a part of the [Latin American Cartographer Community](https://www.halo2.online/forums/) between 2019 and 2023.
- I joined the FSF on December 2023!
