Hi! I'm Mónica Gómez, also known as Autumn64. I am a Computer Systems Engineering student from México, I'm 20 years old, and I'm a proud trans woman and Esperantist. I started developing software in C# back in 2014, but my first contacts with programming date back from 2011 with Commodore BASIC. I also started using GNU/Linux in 2014 with Debian 6, and since then I've witnessed the evolution of the GNU/Linux distributions and community. Nowadays I use [Arch Linux btw](https://archlinux.org/) and I develop free, libre and open-source software in C, Python and JavaScript, although I can also code in Java, C++, Rust and C#.

On October 2023 I won the [contest at MiaVivo.net](https://www.miavivo.net/?status/1-1-1698395536) with the song "Ĝia nomo estas Mia Vivo", and I am an active contributor to Esperantujo through my [PeerTube channel](https://tube.tchncs.de/a/autumn64/video-channels), and by translating all my software to Esperanto. I am also an [indie musician](https://music.autumn64.xyz/), and I frequently upload programming tutorials [in Spanish](https://video.hardlimit.com/c/autumn64/videos) and [Esperanto](https://tube.tchncs.de/c/autumn64.eo/videos). Additionally, I have [a blog in Spanish](https://blog.autumn64.xyz/) and another [in Esperanto](https://blogo.autumn64.xyz/).
