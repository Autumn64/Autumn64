Hi! I'm Mónica Gómez, also known as Autumn64. I am a Computer Systems Engineering student from México, I'm 19 years old, and I'm a proud trans woman and Esperantist. I started developing software in C# back in 2014, but my first contacts with programming date back from 2011 with Commodore BASIC. I also started using GNU/Linux in 2014 with Debian 6, and since then I've witnessed the evolution of the GNU/Linux distributions and community. Nowadays I use [Arch Linux btw](https://archlinux.org/) and I develop free, libre and open-source software in C, Python and JavaScript, although I can also code in Java, C++, Rust and C#.

On October 2023 I won the [contest at MiaVivo.net](https://www.miavivo.net/?status/1-1-1698395536) with the song "Ĝia nomo estas Mia Vivo", and I am an active contributor to Esperantujo through my [PeerTube channel](https://tube.tchncs.de/a/autumn64/video-channels), and by translating all my software to Esperanto. I am also an [indie musician](https://www.autumn64.xyz/src/en/music.html), and I frequently upload programming tutorials [in Spanish](https://video.hardlimit.com/c/autumn64/videos) and [Esperanto](https://tube.tchncs.de/c/autumn64.eo/videos).

- I was actually born on June 11th, but I celebrate my birthday on November 10th (because that's when I came out and only then I felt [I started living](https://blahaj.zone/notes/9olounrnjim62sjf)).
- My pronouns are She/Her.
- I speak Spanish, English, Portuguese, French (quite badly though) and Esperanto, and I'm (unofficially) learning Korean.

- Despite my (extremely) religious past, I currently consider myself to be an irreligious (and somewhat atheist) person.
- A few years ago I used to be an avid K-Pop fan. Nowadays I'm still in contact with a lot of the korean culture, but I usually only listen to TWICE (my favouritest gg and artist ever), MAMAMOO (my 2nd favouritest gg and artist ever), Red Velvet, NewJeans, and Secret Number.
- My favourite K-Drama is probably [Crash Landing on You](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_Landing_on_You), and my favourite K-Film is quite surely [20th Century Girl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Century_Girl).
- [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) FTW!
- [We don't need open-source software, we need free software](https://ploum.net/2023-06-19-more-rms.html)!

- I love quantum mechanics and astronomy/astrophysics.
- I quit using almost any form of privative social media on December 2023.
- I switched to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/Autumn64) on November 2023, while I just use my [GitHub](https://github.com/Autumn64) account to contribute to the FLOSS projects I like/I'm interested in (unless such project accepts patches, which is always my first choice), and to mirror my repositories from Codeberg [#GiveUpGitHub](https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/).
- F*ck Microsoft Word/Google Docs/Apple Pages, all my homies use [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)!
- I was a part of the [Latin American Cartographer Community](https://www.halo2.online/forums/) between 2020 and 2024.
